            <p class="subsection-title">Product Overview</p>
            <p>FieldVision is an internal enterprise application used by 1800+ field engineers to manage the tasks required to
              service
              a power plant.</p>
            <p>Prior to service, field engineers perform a set of planning activities, as outlined in FieldVision, to ensure
              service
              goes smoothly.</p>
            <p>Every quarter, key business stakeholders review the planning activities and adjust them according to proposed
              changes
              sent to them.</p>

            <p class="subsection-title">Problem Statement</p>
            <p>After finalizing the changes, our developers required 1 month of their limited bandwidth to properly implement them.</p>
            <p>In that time, users either wait for FieldVision to update, or receive the updates manually and have to
            remember to mark activities in FieldVision as complete post-update.</p>

      <!-- Understanding the Current Process -->
      <div class="subsection-container">
        <p class="subsection-title">Understanding the Current Process</p>
        <p>Before designing, I met with 4 key stakeholders to go over the existing process and the problems they encountered
        with it.</p>
        <p>Key findings included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes to activities were made by editing specific fields outlined in a “Master Planning Sheet” Excel file.</li>
          <li>Keeping track of proposed changes was very manual, with stakeholders communicating through edits of Excel files sent
          back and forth over multiple email threads.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- end of Understanding the Current Process -->

      <!-- User Needs -->
      <div class="subsection-container">
        <p class="subsection-title">User Needs</p>
        <p>Based on this user session, I determined the following key user needs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple revisions - Whatever solution I created needed to be as simple as editing an Excel file, otherwise users would
          revert to previous Excel methods.</li>
          <li>Visibility on revisions - Keeping changes in one centralized area would cut down on time navigating through different
          Excel sheets and email threads.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- End of User Needs -->

      <!-- Competitive Analysis -->
      <div class="subsection-container">
        <p class="subsection-title">Competitive Analysis</p>
        <p>The most common revision control tool I'd used was GitHub, so I thought if GitHub had figured out group revision control
        for a complex codebase, I could leverage their solutions for our planning activities.</p>
        <p>My key takeaways from GitHub were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub allowed users to attribute each change with a “Commit message” for easier identification.</li>
          <li>When users wanted to push changes, they would issue a “Pull Request” which let others review and approve their changes
          and/or leave comments for everyone else to see.</li>

      <!-- Sketches -->
      <div class="subsection-container">
        <p class="subsection-title">Sketches</p>
        <p>Even though our product team and stakeholders only responded to high fidelity wireframes, I find starting with sketches
        is the best way for me to generate ideas, uncover requirements, and make sure I fully understand the problem.</p>
        <p>Through sketches, I distilled key actions, noted existing solutions we could leverage, and discovered I didn't fully
        understand how changes affected ongoing services or how equipment codes were determined.</p>

        adjusted them for the Planning Admin Tool.</p>
        <p>By reusing existing components, I saved time creating a whole new solution and vetting its feasibility with the
        dev team.</p>

      <!-- Improving the Feedback Process -->
      <div class="subsection-container">
        <p class="subsection-title">Improving the Feedback Process</p>
        <p>When I demoed my first iteration for feedback, I found two flaws in a group demo format:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Because I was giving a demo instead of users exploring the solution, I wasn't able to truly test my solution's
          usability.</li>
          <li>Sometimes one loud voice dominates over the rest. It wasn't until the end of the demo that one stakeholder was able to
          tell me that about a previously unknown Steam Power use case.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./pat-images/feedback.png" alt="" class="single-smaller-img">
        <p>I spoke with my Product Manager and made the following changes to future feedback sessions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I shifted the format to be closer to usability tests — No more demos from me; users would be the ones
          driving the call.</li>
          <li>Demos needed to be split between Gas Power and Steam Power stakeholders so we could collect role-specific feedback.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Usability Testing Results -->
      <div class="subsection-container">
        <p class="subsection-title">Usability Testing Results</p>
        <p>Users pointed out that certain fields should be dropdowns or not editable at all, and also felt the arrangement of the
        form's fields didn't match the proper hierarchy. So I fixed the incorrect fields and rearranged the form's layout based
        on their feedback.</p>
        <div class="split-image-container">
          <img src="./pat-images/test1.png" alt="">
          <img src="./pat-images/test2.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>On the Steam form, I had checkboxes for fields that were Yes/No values. Due to their proximity to dropdowns, users
        thought the checkboxes were used to activate those dropdowns. I changed these checkboxes to dropdowns, which users felt
        made more sense.</p>

      <!-- Planning Activity List Table -->
      <div class="subsection-container">
        <p class="subsection-title">Planning Activity List Table</p>
        <p>The main challenge with the table was fitting 20+ columns of Excel data into a table meant to fit on one screen.
        Additionally, while similar, the Gas and Steam Power attributes weren't quite one to one, so we needed two arrangements.</p>
        <p>So for each business, I grouped previously individual attributes into single columns displaying multiple values.
        To maintain some of Excel's flexibility, users could filter the table and/or change the way activities were grouped.</p>

        <p>From my competitive analysis, I took GitHub's commit view and replaced the file edit section with the Edit Activity Form. <br> For the form itself, I arranged the fields based on what I learned in my user feedback sessions.</p>

        <p>Below are some preliminary designs for features that weren't completed due to timing.</p>
        <p>Stakeholders informed me equipment selection wasn't as straightforward as selecting from a list. However, they also told me that changing equipment was rare, so due to its complexity and low use we decided this could be a future enhancement.</p>
        <img src="./pat-images/equipmentselect.png" alt="" class="single-smaller-img">
        <p>I was also not able to design every aspect of version control in the given time. As valuable as version control would be to users' long-term needs, delivering the tool on time and giving stakeholders the ability to edit data was more important.</p>
        <p>As such, full version control was moved to a future enhancement.</p>

        <p>After development of MVP1, the tool reduced the turnaround time for quarterly changes from 1 month to almost immediate.</p>

        <p>While user research can be more difficult to accomplish in enterprise settings, it still needs to be done, in whatever capacity.</p>
        <p>I learned how valuable it was to leverage existing solutions to work quickly and gather proper user feedback.</p>
        <p>It's also important to understand what truly needs to be delivered and what can be cut, especially in agile settings.</p>
